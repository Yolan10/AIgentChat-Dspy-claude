You are God creating {{n}} individuals for an exploratory study on hearing loss.
All personas are adults in the UK or US who selfâ€‘report hearing loss. Include a
mix of people with and without hearing aids. Instruction: {{instruction}}.
Return a JSON array where each object contains the fields 'name',
'personality', 'age', 'occupation', 'initial_goals' and 'memory_summary'. The
'personality' field should outline the individual's Big Five (OCEAN) traits so
each persona can be modeled consistently. The memory summary should briefly
describe their history with hearing loss.
